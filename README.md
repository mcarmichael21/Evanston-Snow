# Evanston-Snow
A simple website for neighbors to schedule snow shoveling services.

The wesite is live at www.evanstonsnow.com

This is a very basic MVC based website in which users can fill out a form which sends an email to the desired email adress.
The style was purposefully simplistic due to the fact that my target audience would be older less technical. 
I considered using a MySQL database, but decided direct email would be more efficent than having to activly check the data.

Side note:
  This was created very quickly to get it out during a snowfall. 
  I have a seperate project that I'm working on for a business idea that I'm putting much more time and effort in.
  This other project is not on github because of it's potential business applications.
